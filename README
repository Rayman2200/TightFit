TightFit is a "fit tool" for Eve Online(r), and can help you test and check ships and modules without 
spending all the ISK. The main design goals are: speed, and shallow learning curve.

NOTE: To import character data currently does not use EVEAPI. Instead, save character data from EveMON, 
and load that data in TightFit from the config dialog.

 It's Slow!

Yes, I'm aware that can happen. TightFit is a graphics-heavy app, but since it is now compiled for Java 5 there are some options you can use to speed it up a bit. If you have a newer Linux box with GLX, or a Windows box with WGL_ARB_pbuffer extension, then try this command line:

 java -Dsun.java2d.opengl=true -Dsun.java2d.translaccel=true -jar tightfit.jar
