TightFit is a "fit tool" for Eve Online(r), and can help you test and check ships and modules without 
spending all the ISK. The main design goals are: speed, and shallow learning curve.

NOTE: To import character data currently does not use EVEAPI. Instead, save character data from EveMON, 
and load that data in TightFit from the config dialog.
